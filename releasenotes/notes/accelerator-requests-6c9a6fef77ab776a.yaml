    Handling accelerator requests for an instance is now supported (where
    supported by the underlying virt driver) as of microversion
    2.82. The Cyborg service generates an event for the binding
    completion for each accelerator request for an instance.
    Adds a new event ``accelerator_request_bound`` for this to the API:

    * ``POST /os-server-external-events``
